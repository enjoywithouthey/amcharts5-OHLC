# amcharts5-OHLC

I am trying to change each candlestick color based on a random type.  The code is for CRA amCharts5

Create a new chart project in React
https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/getting-started/integrations/react/

My code should work no problem when you have a project going.

Can someone please help?

thanks,
